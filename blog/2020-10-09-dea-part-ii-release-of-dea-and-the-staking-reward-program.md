_As stated in our previous article, DEA is a crucial element of DEUS Finance. It will be the monetary vehicle rewarding stakers and liquidity providers, and the primary mechanism for balancing the treasury/reserve. The relationship between DEUS and DEA will be detailed in our next article. For now, we will focus on DEA’s launch._

During Phase II, we demonstrated that through arbitration, the price of DEUS on the secondary market is pegged to the price on DEUS Swap. Our next move is to open the gates to DEXs by offering DEA as an incentive for liquidity providers. This will allow us to provide stability for the system at later phases.

Furthermore, we decided to add three “Friends-Of-DEUS” pool options, that will be available for staking. This will increase our visibility to other projects and communities relevant to the DEUS ecosystem or aligned with it.

As you will see in the pie chart below, a small portion of DEA’s emission goes directly to the DAO fund, as well as to the early contributors and contractors who have to this day worked tirelessly with little to no financial compensation.

## Initial Distribution: How DEA will be distributed upon Release
1,000,000 DEA will be pre-mined and distributed over a period of six months as follows:
+ 440,928 DEA to three native DEUS pools
+ 98,136 DEA to three “Friends-of-DEUS” tokens (Those only require single tokens instead of Uniswap LP tokens)
+ 280,308 DEA to the reserve
+ 144,312 DEA to the DAO treasury
+ 36,312 DEA to early team members and contributors

#### Friends-of-DEUS single pools

We chose these pools based on their alignment with DEUS Finance, as well as their influence and user base. In the future, we will be able to pick different pools to target different communities.

## What’s Next for DEA?
The official launch of our staking platform will come soon. We are currently undergoing private beta testing. Our developers are working on the first Registrar implementations and are making progress every day.

Our next article will unveil our vision for the future of DEA, inspired by the current monetary system, central bank pillars, and novel concepts, such as adaptive base-money systems. To ensure system solvency, DEUS will employ automated mechanisms that will transfer liquidity to where it’s needed. That is our primary focus at the moment.

Part 3, along with other exciting updates, will be released in the near future. For now, stay tuned and follow us on Telegram & Twitter:
